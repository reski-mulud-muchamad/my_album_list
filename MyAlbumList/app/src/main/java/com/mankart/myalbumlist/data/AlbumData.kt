        "On their fourth album, Avenged Sevenfold go beyond pulverizing hard rock and embrace orchestral influences. Arcs of piano soar through the prog metal of \"Unbound (The Wild Ride)\" and ghoulish strings add zest to the '80s stomp of \"Brompton Cocktail\"; meanwhile, \"A Little Piece of Heaven\" boasts vaudevillian displays of woodwinds, horns, and cello. There are still trademark A7X riff explosions, of course—the double-barreled guitar attack of \"Lost\" or the old-school thrash of \"Almost Easy,\" for example—all of which benefit from the band's ruthless experimentation.",
        "Avenged Sevenfold’s fifth studio album is their first without drummer James “The Reverend” Sullivan, who died in 2009. Dream Theatre’s Mike Portnoy makes for a stellar replacement both musically and sentimentally as Sullivan was largely inspired by the talented Sullivan. Though some fans believe Nightmare to be conceptual, it plays more like a tribute album as the lyrics often touch on the subject of the band’s fallen brother — they also recorded a few of Sullivan’s songs for this project. The title-track opens with M. Shadows belting out fevered vocals like a young James Hetfield by way of the late Layne Staley from Alice In Chains. Synyster Gates’ dexterous guitar leads import the fretboard-shredding harmonic style that was forged in the fires of early-‘80s British metal, especially during the soaring melodies in the chorus of “Welcome to the Family” and all over the powerful “Danger Line.” The wistful “Buried Alive” proves that ballads can still sound tough. The bookending 11-minute epic “Save Me” goes out like a 21-gun salute to Sullivan.",

        "Sometime in 2002, Green Day went into the studio to work on a new album they were tentatively calling Cigarettes and Valentines. The band were tired, cranky, low on ideas and morale. They’d already sold a zillion records, criss-crossed the world and put out a greatest hits album (International Superhits!), something they’d never dreamed of in the days of playing warehouse shows in Berkeley—and arguably something no self-respecting punk band should do anyway. They talked about breaking up. And just like that, the masters for the album—which none of the members had felt all that strongly about to begin with—were stolen from the studio: Bad fortune, good opportunity.\nReleased in 2004, American Idiot wasn’t quite a reincarnation for the band, but it was close. They’d been experimenting with polka music, salsa, dirty versions of Christmas songs and, maybe most radically of all, not sounding angry all the time. In place of the compression that made their early albums so indelible came a strange new dream: Billie Joe Armstrong wanted to write something big and operatic. He wanted to write “Bohemian Rhapsody”.\nWeird as it sounds, it was more or less a logical next step. After all, the band were already playing the arenas—why not act like an arena-rock band? Anchored by two sprawling nine-minute song-suites (“Jesus of Suburbia”, “Homecoming”) and a loose unifying story, American Idiot wasn’t just their most musically varied album (it upped their quotient of military marches, glockenspiel and Celtic-sounding ballads by 100%), but their most emotionally varied one, too, by turns bratty (“American Idiot”), anthemic (“Boulevard of Broken Dreams”), goofy (“She’s a Rebel”) and reflective (“Wake Me Up When September Ends”), sometimes all in the space of the same song.\nAnd where they’d always been political in a casual, lowercase way, here they made their message bolder, channelling their frustrations towards a host of American infirmities, from widening class inequality to the ascendance of religious evangelism to the country’s looping preoccupation with war. In case it wasn’t clear where the band was coming from, Armstrong often performed the title track wearing a novelty mask of George W. Bush.\nMost of all, American Idiot marked the moment when Green Day truly embraced their status as old-fashioned rock stars: ambitious, anthemic, a little clunky, but committed to the big ideas. The album became their best-selling since Dookie and was famously adapted for the distinctly un-punk setting of Broadway—a leap no band of their distinctly subcultural origins had ever really made before. In other words, here was a band by and for losers, finally accepting that they’d won.",
        "Upon its 1975 release, A Night at the Opera was, reportedly, the most expensive album ever recorded. Fortunately, Queen got their money's worth—and then some. Their crowning achievement, this fearlessly eclectic album takes equal inspiration from heavy metal and '20s music hall on tracks like \"I'm in Love with My Car\" and \"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon”, respectively. And that's before the staggering hard rock operetta \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", a cracked masterpiece that no other band could’ve pulled off.",

        "There’s a blissful lack of restraint to the multilayered neon pop of Coldplay’s seventh album. The carnival kicks off within 20 seconds of the opening track and allows only the most fleeting of (Barack Obama-narrated) sit-downs as the extent of their ambition is joyously unfurled. It’s the sound of a band liberated: free to recruit Beyoncé for vocal duties on the euphoric “Hymn for the Weekend”, trade sweet nothings with Tove Lo for hazy holiday romance jam “Fun”and talk Noel Gallagher into a (What’s The Story) Morning Glory?-sized guitar solo on the hymnal “Up&Up”.",
